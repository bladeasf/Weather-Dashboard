# Weather-Dashboard
I built a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
When a user opens the application, they're presented with an input box so they can search for the name of the city.
Once the search button is pressed, the user is given a 5 day, 3 hour forecast of the specific city.
the search history is then saved and shown at the bottom for future use.
the open weather API runs smoothly.

This is the deployed page
